The simplest way to build a platform snap package locally is to run [drone cli](http://docs.drone.io/cli-installation):
````
/path/to/cli/drone jsonnet --stream
sudo /path/to/cli/drone exec --pipeline=[amd64|arm64|arm] --trusted
````

### Install a package on a device
````
snap install --devmode /path/to/package.snap
````
